Time series is one of the fastest growing and richest types of data. In a variety of domains including dynamical systems, healthcare, climate science and economics, there have been increasing amounts of complex dynamic data due to a shift away from parsimonious, infrequent measurements to nearly continuous real-time monitoring and recording. This burgeoning amount of new data calls for novel theoretical and algorithmic tools and insights.

[TorchTS](https://rose-stl-lab.github.io/torchTS/) is a deep learning library for time series forecasting built on [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/). The tools in this library mostly come out the research from [Spatiotemporal Machine Learning Lab](https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab). The library is designed with minimal dependencies and user-friendly interfaces. A particular emphasis of the library is scalability, which exploits auto-differentiation and various inductive biases in the data.
