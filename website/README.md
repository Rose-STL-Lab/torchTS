# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

**Important**: API Reference page doesn't get updated automatically. We will have to run the following commands in order to build API Docs with Sphinx

```bash
source ./scripts/build_docs.sh  # mac
./scripts/build_docs.sh  # window
```

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

```console
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
